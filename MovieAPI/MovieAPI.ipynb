    "### Introduction to the project\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to my project! The purpose of this project is to effectively design a Python program with the main functionality to allow users to search for information about movies contained in the Open Movie Database (omdb). This file starts with Section A, containing the full functional program code, and then is followed by Section B outlining the documentation explaining some core concepts, the code, retrospective, and help documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Core Functionality\n",
    "My program has two main functionalities:\n",
    "1. Allowing users to search for new movies in the movies database\n",
    "2. Allowing users to view information about movies that they have previously searched. \n",
    "\n",
    "If they search for a new movie, then they first given the default response of a movie match with the most recent year or most accurate match. They are then given the option to specify their search through providing a year (with the options of the years and movie titles being provided). If they wish to get information about a movie that they have previously searched for, then they should provide the exact title of that movie (with the list of titles being displayed for them to choose from). \n",

    "1. Install and import all necessary modules. This is done automatically by running block 1. If an error persists stating that you do not have a module, then just add that to your installed modules through `!pip install <moduleName>` in the first block.\n",
    "2. Run the program by running the second block. Enter 1 to search for information of a movie that you have already searched for. Enter 2 to search for a new movie. Follow the instructions presented.\n",
    "3. You can quit the program at any point by entering 'q' when asked for user input.\n",
    "4. You can be directed to the main menu at any point by entering 'm' when asked for user input.\n",
    "5. If an error occurs, it is likely to be that the connection timed out. To solve this problem, try rerunning the first block (connecting the api key), or restart the kernel and make sure to run 1) and 2) again.\n",
    "6. Navigate to Section B for more documentation."

    "### API explaination \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand how to interact with the OMDB RESTful API, let's have a look at firstly what a RESTful API is, and secondly how the OMDB API works.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a (RESTful) API?\n",
    "An Application Program Interface (API) is a web-based interface and can be defined as a contract between applications that sets out the pattern of interactions between two application components. In layman's terms, it defines the rules on how to communicate with the program. API’s are tools that allow users to retrieve data from a database and use it. In other words, the API acts as an interface which the user can use to communicate with the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "An API key is used to identify an entity (a user or program wishing to communicate with the API), and checks whether the entity has authorisation. If the entity has authorisation, then they can interact with the API according to the rules defined in the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "An API consists primary of 3 main components:\n",
    "1. the user (who makes requests)\n",
    "2. the server (computers responding the requests from the user)\n",
    "3. the client (computer that sends the request to a server)\n",
    "\n",
    "A REpresentational State Transfer (RESTful) API is a software architectural style. In essense, when a client request is made through a RESTful API, it transfers a representation of the state of the resource on the server to the client. \n",
    "In order for an API to be considered RESTful, it must conform to six architectural constraints namely: uniform interface, stateless, catchable, client-server, layered system and code on demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How does the OMDB API work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Open Movie Database (OMDB) is a free website service which allows users to look up and search for infomation about movies from its database. A (private) API key needs to be requested to use the OMDB RESTful API. The user needs to use the API key in order to fetch and retrieve information about movies, and the API responds with the result in JSON format by default. To set your api key, one calls the `set_default()` function, with your API key as a parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two main functions used in this program is the omdb API's `get()` and `search()` functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `get()` function retrieves generic response according to the keyword provided, and gives the response as a dictionary. At least the title or the imdbID needs to be provided. Further than that, additional parameters can be provided to customise the response, such as the year released, actors, director, etc. By default, if the title is provided with no additional parameters, then the movie/series/game matching that title the closest or has the most recent release date is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `search()` function retrieves a list of dictionaries containing the response. At least the title or the imdbID needs to be provided. Further than that, one can also provide the year and the type as optional parameters. The function retrieves a response in the format of a list of dictionaries with movies matching the imdbID or substring matches for the movie title provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also other more specialised functions in the omdb API, such as the `search_movie()`, `search_episode()`, `imdbid()` etc, but they were not used in this program as they are basically just subsets of the generic `get()` and `search()` functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Below showcases an example of how the `set_default()`, `get()`, and `search()` functions were used.\n"

They are given a default response according to the most recent year of the title given or the most exact match to their input. In addition to this, they are given the years and titles of movies that also match their query.

    "To search for a new movie, the user needs to supply the title of the movie that they wish to search for. If they enter a title which does not yield a response from the omdb database, then they are displayed an appropriate message indicating that their search was not found. If their search is valid, they are given a default response according to omdb's `get()` function and given the option to get a more customised response if they provide a specific year. They are enabled to do this by the fact that the search matches (titles and years) are displayed underneath their default response, and a check is done beforehand to make sure that the title-year combination does yield a valid response. The years of the movies are sorted in descending order using Object Orientated Programming (discussed in the next section).\n",
    "\n",
    "If they have not searched for the given movie before (i.e. it is not in their search history), then their search result is written to their history file. If they have searched for the movie before, then they are given a friendly message as a response and their result is not outputted to their search history. This is a design decision to maximise user experience when displaying the search history, such that duplicate searched aren't displayed and they can easily search for what they need."

    "#### Challenges and Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "*Understanding the API*\n",
    "    \n",
    "The first challenge I encountered in my project was that I did not clearly understand how a RESTful API worked. Additionally, I was confused about the process of how to interact with the OMDB RESTful API. My solution to this issue was that I spent many hours doing background research into finding out specifically what a RESTful API is and how to interact with the OMDB RESTful API, before starting my coding. I also went to tutorials to receive guidance on how I could tackle this project.\n",
    "    \n",
    "*Catering for invalid user input*\n",
    "\n",
    "Another challenge I faced was figuring out how to handle unexpected inputs from a user. To solve this issue I ensured that my program was robust and basically tried breaking it to identify possible pitfalls. For these issues identified I subsequently wrote the code to handle these issues at every stage where the user is asked for input. I also considered a user-friendly design, allowing for the best user experience.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### What I learned \n",
    "\n",
    "Through this project I learned how to successfully apply the theory covered in this course in practice. I found this to be challenging throughout the duration of the project as I had to do alot of research and use trial and error before I was able to get my program to sufficiently run. As a result of this project I have not only improved my understanding of the general theory covered in the course however I have gained additional experience in the  practical implementation of python coding.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### What you would add\n",
    "\n",
    "*Better user interface (GUI)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, to improve my project I would have liked to have a better User interface. For example, the use of a Graphical User Interface. This could be implemented at the menu, for example, allowing the user to click the option they want instead of needing to type it in.\n",
    "\n",
    "*More searching features*\n",
    "    \n",
    "It would have been ideal if users were able to search for actors, however this did not seem possible given that the get function requires a title (or an imdb ID, linking to a specific movie). Additionally, it would have been nice to show the poster of the movie that the user searches for.\n",
    " \n",
    "  \n",
    "*More Orientated Object Programming (OOP)*\n",
    "\n",
    "A further improvement would be to include more Orientated Object Programming (OOP) in my main program. I would  like to have saved an individual user's search history and allowed users to create their own profiles to access and view their respective search histories."
